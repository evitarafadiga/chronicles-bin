# Chronicles of the Binarity Android Game
> RPG survival game gender-neutral inclusive.   

![](header.gif)
The Chronicles of the Binarity (Crônicas da Binaridade in portuguese) is an isometric pixel-art game built from the [2D Isometric Tilemaps](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/2D_IsoTilemaps) offered by Unity, without using any of its sprites, etc. 

Once the original project doesn't have any GUI or gaming features hence I intend to confect and publish it soon in multiple languages and operating systems. 

What makes the project important to me is the fact that the storytelling is gender-neutral and expected to fit to any kind of both players and cultures.
