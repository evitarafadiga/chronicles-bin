The Chronicles of the Binarity (Crônicas Binárias in portuguese) is an isometric pixel-art game built from the [2D Isometric Tilemaps](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/2D_IsoTilemaps) offered by Unity, without using any of its graphics, sprites, scripts, etc. An original project.

What makes the project important is the fact that the storytelling is gender-neutral and expected to fit to any kind of both players and cultures. Enjoy!
